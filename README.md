# first_cpp_project

This is my first C++ Program that calculates the sum and average of three numbers. It demonstrates basic input/output operations, variable usage, and arithmetic operations in C++.

Instructions on how I compile or run the code:
1. I downloaded the C++ app compiler called "Coding C++".
2. Wrote the code that I chose to program.
3. Runs the program successfuly and saved it as: "main.cpp".
4. Directly opens the Github.
6. Uploaded the C++ project file I created.
